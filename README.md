# TheOracle - A Ritual Interface for Emotional Styling
Repo for The Oracle 

**The Oracle** is an experimental AI-powered styling tool designed to help users dress with intention, care, and emotional clarity. It invites users to reflect on how they want to feel — and translates that into wardrobe suggestions using a blend of their existing pieces, emotional archetypes, and mindful guidance.

## 🌿 Vision

The Oracle reimagines fashion as a daily ritual of self-tending. Instead of chasing trends or overconsumption, it encourages users to reconnect with their existing wardrobe, their feelings, and their evolving identity. It is:

- Emotion-first, not trend-first  
- Reflective, not prescriptive  
- Rooted in care, not consumption

## 🧠 Core Features

- **Base Style Profile**: Users create a foundational style identity — aesthetic values, emotional needs, lifestyle traits.
- **Daily Mood Input**: Each day, users reflect on their current mood, energy, and intentions.
- **Styling Archetypes**: Based on emotional archetypes (e.g., “Grounded,” “Seen,” “Armored”), The Oracle matches outfits or suggests symbolic pieces.
- **Wardrobe Curation**: When possible, The Oracle selects from user-uploaded wardrobe items to reduce overconsumption.
- **Bridging Suggestions**: If an outfit doesn't resonate, The Oracle offers “bridging” ideas to gently shift or expand one’s style.

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Backend**: Django + PostgreSQL
- **LLM Logic**: OpenAI (via prompt chains for archetype alignment & reflection)
- **Storage**: Neon (wardrobe database & daily inputs)

## 📂 Project Status
